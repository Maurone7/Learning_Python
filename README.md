# Learning_Python

This repository contains some of the work I have done for one of my coding classes. Feel free to read the description of the problem and try it out. Once finished you can check the solution right under.

REMEMBER! Your code can be correct and be different from mine, run both of the codes and check if you get the same output.

GOOD LUCK! Coding is fun, hard, and very rewarding.
