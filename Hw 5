# EX 1
# Description: Let’s consider a simple problem to predict dog years/ages following the assumptions: 
# (Ref: https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/how-to-calculate-your-dogs-age)
# •A 1-year old dog ~ 15 year-old kid
# •A 2-year old dog ~ 24-year old adult
# •Every further dog year corresponds to ~ 4 - 5 human years 
# Write a python script to calculate dog’ age (approximately) using the criteria of age and weight from the website

age = int(input("Age of the dog: "))
print("weight = small if <= 20 lbs")
print("weight = medium if 21-50 lbs")
print("weight = large if >= 50 lbs")
weight=input("Weight of the dog: small/medium/large")
if age < 0:
print("This can hardly be true!")
elif age == 1:
print("about 15 human years")
elif age == 2:
print("about 24 human years")
elif age > 2 and age < 6:
human = 24 + (age -2)*4
print("Human years: ", human)
elif age >= 6 and weight == "small":
human = 24 + (age -2)*4
print("Human years: ", human)
elif age >= 6 and weight == "medium":
human = int(25 + (age -2)*4.5)
print("Human years: ", human)
elif age >= 6 and weight == "large":
human = 25 + (age -2)*5
print("Human years: ", human)


# EX 2
# Description: Write a python code to consider this condition for payment when the purchase amount (amount) is:
# If  amount < 1000, discount = 5%
# If amount < 5000, discount = 10%
# Other amount, discount = 20%
# To make the purchase amount be flexible, use input() function to define any arbitrary purchase amount.


amount = int(input("Enter amount: "))
if amount<1000:
discount = amount*0.05
print ("Discount",discount)
elif amount<5000:
discount = amount*0.10
print ("Discount",discount)
else:
discount = amount*0.20
print ("Discount",discount)
print ("The payment is: ",amount-discount)
